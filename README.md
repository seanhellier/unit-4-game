# unit-4-game

The purpose of this exercise is to learn how to deal with arrays and with random number variables.

For me, this was a pivotal moment, when what i've learned so far came together, including the Bootstrap framework, javascript, and jQuery.

I certainly have no commamd of any of those technologies, but I have at last learned how to muddle through.
